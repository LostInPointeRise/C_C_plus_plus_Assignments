Is there a difference in the results? If so, say what and why in your report?

-> the "Move assignment test" is slightly faster than the "Copy assignment test". 
This happens , because "Move"-Operations, do not need to take care of the state of the object, 
which is used to retrieve values from. 

To be more precisely, all resources, claimed, by the object that will be "moved" to another one, 
gets freed.
