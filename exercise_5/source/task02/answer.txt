-> In my solution, i did insert an object, before the main method, to ensure the 
message  "---start---" will be prompted. 

// Example in code 

-> HelloWorldChanger change;

int main(void) {
    
    std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;    
}

-> The message is prompted, cause  variables defined outside of functions,  
like global variables, are is initialized before main() is invoked.

-> If we take a look at the constrcutor definition of  HelloWorldChanger, 
we can se, that it calls a certain "prompting" Method. 

-> Because , the lifecycle, of the specific HelloWorldChanger object, ends at the 
end of the main method, a destructor-method, of the class can be invoked by the compiler. 

Thats why  ~HelloWorldChanger() contains a method that shall print the message "---end---"
