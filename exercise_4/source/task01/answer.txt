1.) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the macro and function solutions?

Advantages: 

1.) macros offer a neat way, to use functions-like operations. 

Disadvantages: 

Macros are difficult to debug, because they are simply "text-replacements". 

Macros do not belong to any namespace.
A certain macro can be overwritten, by one in another section.


2.) Why does the commented line in the code not compile? 

The problem with the certain function, is that 
it does not match a specifc signature, of the maxf function. 

-> maxf(a,b+0.2), uses an integer-like value for a, and a double like value for b. 

3.) Which maxf() functions are called for the maxf1-maxf3 outputs and why?

maxf1 = In maxf(int) -> (a = 10, b = 22), a and b are simply integer values
maxf2 = In maxf(double) -> (a = 10.1, b = 22.2), a and b are simply double values
22.2
maxf3 = In maxf(int) -> (a = 10, b = 22), a and b are simply integer values
22
