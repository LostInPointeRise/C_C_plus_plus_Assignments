Why is it better to use pre- increment/pre-decrement instead of post-increment/post-decrement operators?

In my point of view "post-increment/post-decrement" are not intuitive. 
At first one would think , that values that are  "post-increment/post-decrement", 
would return a changed value, instead of the original one.

Additionally the post-increment operator in user defined types, needs to create 
a copy of the original object. 

So this will slow down the "incrementation process", in comparision to the pre-incrementation.
