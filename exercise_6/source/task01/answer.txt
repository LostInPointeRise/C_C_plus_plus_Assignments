Why is it not necessary to overload comparison operators to compare two MyTime objects? 

-> It is not necessary, cause we already have added a "conversion function" that allows us, 
to cast a MyTime Object to an in. 

-> The comparison operator, works on integers, so he will use two MyTime objects as ints (internally, 
the objects are casted to ints).
